        <h1>Success</h1>
        <p class="para">It may sound unfit to some peoples but success depends a lot of hard work. Without it, you canâ€™t become successful. Hard work does not mean that you do laborious work or the work that make you sweat. Hard work means having a healthy body, strong mind, willpower and positive attitude towards things. And for all those things you need energy. So, be attentive to your body and soul.</p>
